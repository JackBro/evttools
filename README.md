This project provides tools for operating with windows Event Log Viewer binary log files.

Currently there are two tools present:
  * **evt2csv**, which converts the binary format to CSV
  * **csv2evt**, which converts CSV back to the binary format

**The code is awaiting a heavy rewrite. You can make it faster by donating (contact me).**

At the moment, I am not working on it, since I have other important things on my list.

I cannot recommend you using this beta version.
